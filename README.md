# Helping Hand ✋

# Product Description
  The Helping Hand product is for students (of all ages) and teachers who need a quick way to communicate questions when students aren’t able to raise their hand the way they could in an in-person classroom. Helping Hands is an extension that provides fast help to students and an admin-like user interface for teachers to access help requests from and set up communication (e.g., video call, chat), fast. If available the teacher can connect to that student in one or two clicks. Unlike other services or communication platforms, Helping Hands is the fastest way for students to be connected to the right person for help. Our product is unique because it can be used through any site that the teacher connects it to, preventing the student from having to ever leave the application or type an email.
  Helping Hand aims to increase student engagement during online learning as well as give teachers and students resources to easily communicate during the school day. With Helping Hand, teachers and students will not have to monitor their emails and responses constantly can be given within minutes rather than hours. This will hold students accountable to get their work done during designated school hours because that is when help can be provided. It will increase the quality of the educational experience as students will get the explanations they need from the right sources. 
  The idea for our product is to create a way for kids to complete their online assignments and reach their teacher for help when they get stuck as efficiently as possible. While the student completes the assignment, there would be a simple UI when student information is entered, the teacher would be notified via a list of students. It would inform the teacher which particular student needs help. This would be implemented through a google extension that the student would add, as well as a user interface for the teacher to access all of the help requests. The teacher would be able to either select if they are currently ready to help and a google meet link would be set up and sent to the student, select an estimated wait time for the student to see, or send a quick message.
