# Helping Hand ✋

# Product Description
  The Helping Hand product is for students (of all ages) and teachers who need a quick way to communicate questions when students aren’t able to raise their hand the way they could in an in-person classroom. Helping Hands is an extension that provides fast help to students and an admin-like user interface for teachers to access help requests from and set up communication (e.g., video call, chat), fast. This would be implemented through a google extension that the student would add, as well as a user interface for the teacher to access all of the help requests. If available the teacher can connect to that student in one or two clicks. Unlike other services or communication platforms, Helping Hands is the fastest way for students to be connected to the right person for help. Our product is unique because it can be used through any site that the teacher connects it to, preventing the student from having to ever leave the application or type an email.
